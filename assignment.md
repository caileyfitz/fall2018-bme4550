# Instructions for submitting assignments via GitHub classroom

1. Open a terminal on your computer so that you can push to GitHub via the command line.

2. In command line, navigate to directory (or create one) where your homework files will live. For example, if I am already in my BME 4550 directory and want to make a folder for Homework and then nest another folder, Assignment1, under the homework folder, I would input the following commands: 

  `mkdir Homework` Make Homework folder
  
  `cd Homework` Change directory to Homework folder
  
  `mkdir Assignment1` Make Assignment1 folder
  
  `cd Assignment1` Change directory to Assignment1 folder
 
 3.
