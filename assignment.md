# Instructions for submitting assignments via GitHub classroom

1. Open a terminal on your computer so that you can push to GitHub via the command line.

2. In command line, navigate to directory (or create one) where your homework files will live. For example, if I am already in my BME 4550 directory and want to make a folder for Homework and then nest another folder, Assignment1, under the homework folder, I would input the following commands: 
```
  mkdir Homework
  cd Homework
  mkdir Assignment1
  cd Assignment1
```
